			<h2>WATCH YOUR HEAD</h2>
			<p>Ultimate Frisbee is a sport that I never played myself , but it's popularity is something hard to ignore in many Midwestrn college towns students(and people who wishthey were still students) spend the few briefs months of good weather, sprinting down field , hurling fribees, and yelling" stack!!".</p>
			<p>What i find much more intertaning is the large number of people who continue to play when the weather gets windy and the night sky darkens around oh...4.15pm.The sight of fribess bomeranging in the wind is topped only by the knowldge that even when you can't seem, those same plastics dices death are probably hurting through thre dark night sky at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening.
			</p>
			<p>Ultimate Fribee requirs a great deal of stamina and dexterity. Not surprisngly.the <abbr title="International Olympic committee">IOC</abbr> officially recognized ultimate as a spot in 2005. It can go up against other sportsfor inclusion in olympic games.</p>
